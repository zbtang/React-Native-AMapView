# Change Log

## 0.8.2 (September 8, 2016)

We realized immediately after publishing 0.8.1 that the NPM package contained
some test code in the `example2/` directory that contained a copy of the
`react-native` package, causing this packager error:

```
Failed to build DependencyGraph: @providesModule naming collision:
  Duplicate module name: String.prototype.es6
  Paths: /Users/<path to project>/node_modules/react-native-maps/example2/node_modules/react-native/packager/react-packager/src/Resolver/polyfills/String.prototype.es6.js collides with /Users/<path to project>/node_modules/react-native/packager/react-packager/src/Resolver/polyfills/String.prototype.es6.js

This error is caused by a @providesModule declaration with the same name accross two different files.
```

0.8.2 is identical to 0.8.1, except with the offending code removed from the NPM package.


## 0.8.1 (September 8, 2016) *[DEPRECATED]*

#### *NOTE: 0.8.1 has been unpublished from NPM beacuse it was faulty. Please use 0.8.2.*
